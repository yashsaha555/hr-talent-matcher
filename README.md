### Database Schema
```
employees (id, name, department, role, experience_years, salary, location, career_aspirations)
skills (id, skill_name, category, description)
employee_skills (employee_id, skill_id, proficiency_level, years_experience)
projects (id, name, description, priority, duration, budget, status)
project_skills (project_id, skill_id, importance_level, required_proficiency)
development_paths (id, name, description, duration, target_roles)
matching_results (employee_id, project_id, match_score, analysis, recommendations)
```

### AI Algorithms

#### 1. Skill Matching Algorithm
```python
def calculate_skill_match_score(employee_id, project_id):
    # Get employee skills and project requirements
    # Calculate weighted compatibility score
    # Apply proficiency level adjustments
    # Return normalized score (0-1)
```

#### 2. Experience Compatibility
```python
def calculate_experience_compatibility(employee_id, project_id):
    # Analyze years of experience vs project complexity
    # Apply duration and priority adjustments
    # Factor in role seniority requirements
    # Return compatibility score
```

#### 3. Career Alignment Analysis
```python
def calculate_career_alignment_score(employee_id, project_id):
    # Semantic similarity between career goals and project
    # Role keyword overlap analysis
    # Growth opportunity assessment
    # Return alignment score
```

#### 4. Comprehensive Matching
```python
final_score = (
    skill_score * 0.45 +
    experience_score * 0.25 +
    career_score * 0.20 +
    availability_score * 0.10
)
```
